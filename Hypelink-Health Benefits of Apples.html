<li>1. Apples May Lower High Cholesterol and Blood Pressure</li>
<p>Savor a juicy apple and you may help keep your ticker healthy in the process. “Studies have linked apple consumption with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, which may be related to the cholesterol-lowering benefits of the soluble fiber found in apples,” says Anzlovar. </p>

<p>Soluble fiber dissolves in water to form a gel-like material, according to Mayo Clinic. </p>

<p>According to the University of Illinois, soluble fiber helps prevent cholesterol buildup in the lining of blood vessel walls, therefore lowering the incidence of atherosclerosis (restricted blood flow in the arteries due to plaque buildup) and heart disease. It can also help lower blood pressure levels: One past review found that a higher intake of soluble fiber was associated with a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease.</p>

<p>Past research shows that eating apples (or pears) regularly was associated with a 52 percent lower stroke risk. Furthermore, a study published in February 2020 in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that eating two apples a day helped study participants lower both their LDL (“bad”) cholesterol and triglyceride levels.</p>

<li>2. Eating Foods With Fiber, Including Apples, Can Aid Digestion</li>
<p>You’ve likely heard that fiber is good for digestion — and what you’ve heard is true! According to the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, both types of fiber (soluble and insoluble, which means it can’t be absorbed in water) are important for digestion. And you’re in luck — apples have both types, according to the University of Illinois.</p>

<p>Soluble fiber helps slow down digestion, allowing you to feel full, and also slows the digestion of glucose, which helps control your blood sugar. Meanwhile, insoluble fiber can help move food through your system and aid with constipation and regularity, per Harvard.</p>

<p>Be sure to eat the apple skin, which contains much of the apple’s insoluble fiber, according to the University of Illinois.</p>

<li>3. Apples Can Support a Healthy Immune System</li>
<p>Who doesn’t want a stronger immune system going into autumn? Apples can be an important tool in your immune-supporting tool kit.</p>

<p>According to past research in animals, a diet filled with soluble fiber helped convert immune cells that were pro-inflammatory into anti-inflammatory and immune-supporting ones. Another animal study, published in May 2018 in the journal Immunity, found that a diet high in dietary fiber helped protect mice against the flu. (It’s not clear whether these effects would occur in humans, though.)</p>

<p>Still, there’s reason to believe that apples may bolster immunity, in part because they contain immune-boosting vitamin C. One past large review found that regular consumption of vitamin C plays many roles in helping the immune system function. For example, it can help strengthen the epithelial (a type of tissue) barrier against pathogens and guard against environmental oxidative stress, such as pollution and radiation, according to past research.</p>
<li>4. Apples Are a Diabetes-Friendly Fruit</li>
<p>If you have type 2 diabetes, consider adding apples to your diet. Sure, they’re a fruit, but it’s a common misconception that people with diabetes can’t eat fruit.</p>

<p>In this case, apples’ soluble fiber can help slow the absorption of sugar into the bloodstream and may improve blood sugar levels, Mayo Clinic notes. Plus, per Mayo, a healthy diet that includes insoluble fiber can lower your odds of developing type 2 diabetes in the first place.</p>

<p>Furthermore, a study of people with type 2 diabetes, published in August 2016 in Experimental and Therapeutic Medicine, found that regularly consuming soluble fiber helped reduce insulin resistance and improved blood sugar and triglyceride levels.</p>

<li>5.The Antioxidants in Apples May Play a Role in Cancer Prevention</li>
<p>While there’s no one surefire way to prevent cancer, apples may help play a role in fighting off these diseases. “Apples may reduce the risk of certain cancers, which researchers speculate is related to the antioxidants found in apples,” says Anzlovar. Past research suggests that apples are high in antioxidants, and in laboratory studies, these antioxidants have been shown to limit cancer cell growth.</p>

<p>A review published in October 2016 in Public Health Nutrition found that eating apples regularly is associated with a reduced risk of certain cancers, including colorectal, oral cavity, esophageal, and breast cancers.</p>

<p>The fiber in apples may provide cancer-preventing perks. A study published in March 2016 in the journal Pediatrics found that women who ate more high-fiber foods during adolescence
